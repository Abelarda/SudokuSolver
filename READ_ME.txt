=== Sudoku Solver README ===
============================

Project in Python that solves any Sudoku puzzle (of any difficulty).
It uses the AC3 constraint satisfaction algorithm, famous in the field
of Artificial Intelligence.

This algorithm is only able to solve easy difficulty Sudoku puzzles, 
so in this project there are also a couple extensions to the algorithm that
involve the use of guesses in order to solve any Sudoku puzzle.
